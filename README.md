ðŸ”‘ Project Features
- Authentication â€“ Registration, login, session management via JWT.
- User List â€“ Displaying all users.
- Recipe List â€“ Viewing recipes with tag-based filtering.
- Search â€“ Debounced search for users and recipes.
- Pagination â€“ Lazy loading of items.
- Dynamic Routes â€“ /users/[id], /recipes/[id], /recipes/tag/[tag].

	
**1. Authentication & Session Management**

The project uses JWT tokens for user authentication.

 
- When logging in, the user sends a request to the API (authApi.ts).
- The server returns an accessToken and refreshToken, which are stored in localStorage.
- The accessToken is included in the headers for authorization with each request.
- If the accessToken expires, the refreshToken is used to obtain a new token.
- When logging out, tokens are removed, and the session is reset.

  
**2. User & Recipe Search**

A client-side search is implemented using a custom hook useFindItems.tsx.

 
- The user enters a search query in the input field.
- Debounce (300ms delay) prevents excessive API requests.
- Data is fetched via an API request (getData.ts) or filtered from a local array.
- Results are displayed in SearchResults.tsx.
- Clicking outside the search field clears the input.

  
**3. Fetching & Displaying Data**

The project uses custom hooks and API requests to retrieve data.

 
- useGetSingleItem.ts â€“ Fetches a single item (user/recipe).
- getUserRecipes(userId) â€“ Retrieves all recipes for a specific user.
- useGetPaginatedItems.ts â€“ Fetches paginated lists of recipes/users.
- Data is cached in local state using useState.

  
**4. Dynamic Pages in Next.js**

The project uses Next.js App Router for routing.

 
- /users/[id] â€“ User profile page.
- /recipes/[id] â€“ Recipe details page.
- /recipes/tag/[tag] â€“ Recipe filtering by tags.

  
**5. Styling & UI**

The project uses SCSS for component styling.

 
- Each component has its own SCSS file (SearchResults.scss, UserItem.scss, etc.).
- Animations are applied using transition and hover.
- A CSS module approach is used for style isolation.
